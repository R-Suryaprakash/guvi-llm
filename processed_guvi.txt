gu vi named as an acronym of grab your vern acular imprint is an online platform to learn computer programming based in ind ia it offers free and paid coding courses to students and working professionals in ind ian languages such as hind i tel ugu k ann ada b eng ali tam il and in english gu vi s mission is to make technical education available to all in their native languages
history
gu vi was started as a youtube channel in 2011 the channel posted video tutorials courses and practice materials created by ar un pra k ash s ride vi ar un pra k ash and sp bal am ur ug an the videos were posted in tam il tel ugu and mar athi with the goal of reaching people not fluent in english
the trio quit their job in 2014 and started gu vi as a company seeded with an initial capital of 1 000 000 the start up was incub ated at the rural technology and business incub ator r t bi based out of i it mad ras the start up raised seed funding of 500 000 and officially launched in no ve mber 2014

gu vi offered free online coding courses in march 2020 during the cov id 19 pand emic lockdown in ind ia 7 8
recogn ition and awards
gu vi was supported by google s launch pad accelerator program in 2017

gu vi provides video tutorials college courses assignments and practice papers to students who aspire to build careers in the field of information technology and does so in english and vern acular languages currently tam il tel ugu and k ann ada
founded by c hen nai based software professionals ar un pra k ash s p bal am ur ug an and m s ride vi gu vi was born four years ago we went to our college in mad urai for an alumni meet and because we were there after a long time the expectation was that everything right from the infrastructure to teaching methodology and other aspects of the learning environment would have improved but we were disappointed to see that things were actually worse while the infrastructure had improved the amount of exposure students received to the outside world remained the same so we wanted to do something about it ar un pra k ash recol lected
one thing that stood out was the fact that there were many talented students but they were held back by the language barrier their sparse knowledge of english made it difficult for them to follow lessons particularly those related to computers said ar un
the trio returned to c hen nai and began thinking of ways to help these students soon gu vi was born initially just as a youtube channel we started a youtube channel and started uploading instructional videos in vern acular languages for instance if you wanted to learn coding or programming in your native tongue you could do that said ar un the channel soon had over 4 000 subscribers and more than a million views many students from tier 2 and tier 3 cities wrote in letting them know that the videos had a positive impact on their lives this motivated the founders and they decided to quit their jobs to launch an official gu vi platform that would make available mentors practice material and job opportunities
ar un had 14 years of experience in the it industry and had worked with sym ant ec earlier bal am ur ug an and s ride vi had worked with pay pal leaving behind this cush ioned corporate life the three of them registered gu vi in no ve mber 2014 soon enough the start up received a chance to work with the q ee e project which aims to teach the python programming in 150 colleges in ind ia in local languages
in order to util ise gu vi students must create their accounts on the website and in turn they gain access to most of the videos free of cost students who opt to sign up for special packages advanced courses practice assignments etc have to pay fees ranging from rs 800 to rs 3 000 all the videos are made by industry professionals who work in the particular technology field if it is a video about android programming a developer who has some six years of experience in the field makes it or provides a voice over for it the content is made only by experts who have hands on knowledge said ar un gu vi has courses on programming from the beginner to expert levels databases web development and mobile development
the platform has evolved with the needs of the students when we were doing only videos we got requests to include some theory lessons and exercises for students to practise so we included those soon start ups began to approach us about hiring our students so we set up a recruitment channel said ar un
today gu vi has over 40 000 users of which 10 000 users pay for the advanced courses students with little knowledge of english or with no background in programming can simply use personal computers to log on to the portal and learn using the available instructional videos they can also use the various learning exercises to hone their skills their performance in these exercises is reflected in a profile which is used as a resume by prospective employers to assess their skills the platform also gives reward points to users who practise and finish their courses which is again visible on their performance profiles
ar un estimates that at least 30 000 students have benef itted from the portal and are now proficient in computer programming they use p cs to practice what they learn and are equipped with the right set of skills for different jobs the pay package these students attract is anywhere between rs 2 5 lakh to rs 12 lakh annually depending on their skills and the field given that many of these students are first time graduates from their families it s a huge step forward for them
ar un is proud of the fact that the widespread reach of gu vi has helped many talented girls gain access to a platform where they can learn practise and challenge assumptions about their expertise once a hi tech startup company was hiring from gu vi many people assume boys are better at programming than girls but we shattered this stereotype during the hiring process when the first person selected for the job was a girl this is a platform where girls too come and showcase their skills and this is mainly because they find role models here one of these is a girl who we ment ored and who now works as a developer she says if it were not for gu vi she would have been married and without a job by now said ar un proudly
gu vi has made knowledge that is useful to many students seeking careers in the it industry accessible regardless of their linguistic backgrounds with hard work and dedication there is no reason that they cannot go forward rise in their careers and fulfil their unt apped potential

history
gu vi was started as a youtube channel in 2011 the channel posted video tutorials courses and practice materials created by ar un pra k ash s ride vi ar un pra k ash and sp bal am ur ug an the videos were posted in tam il tel ugu and mar athi with the goal of reaching people not fluent in english
the trio quit their job in 2014 and started gu vi as a company seeded with an initial capital of 1 000 000 the start up was incub ated at the rural technology and business incub ator r t bi based out of i it mad ras the start up raised seed funding of 500 000 and officially launched in no ve mber 2014
gu vi received its first institutional round of funding of 10 000 000 from us based gray matters capital s ed l abs in apr il 2019 it raised 60 000 000 in its pre series a round of funding from education catalyst fund an education focused venture capital fund managed by c ba capital in apr il 2020

gu vi was supported by google s launch pad accelerator program in 2017

gu vi provides video tutorials college courses assignments and practice papers to students who aspire to build careers in the field of information technology and does so in english and vern acular languages currently tam il tel ugu and k ann ada
founded by c hen nai based software professionals ar un pra k ash s p bal am ur ug an and m s ride vi gu vi was born four years ago we went to our college in mad urai for an alumni meet and because we were there after a long time the expectation was that everything right from the infrastructure to teaching methodology and other aspects of the learning environment would have improved but we were disappointed to see that things were actually worse while the infrastructure had improved the amount of exposure students received to the outside world remained the same so we wanted to do something about it ar un pra k ash recol lected
one thing that stood out was the fact that there were many talented students but they were held back by the language barrier their sparse knowledge of english made it difficult for them to follow lessons particularly those related to computers said ar un
the trio returned to c hen nai and began thinking of ways to help these students soon gu vi was born initially just as a youtube channel we started a youtube channel and started uploading instructional videos in vern acular languages for instance if you wanted to learn coding or programming in your native tongue you could do that said ar un the channel soon had over 4 000 subscribers and more than a million views many students from tier 2 and tier 3 cities wrote in letting them know that the videos had a positive impact on their lives this motivated the founders and they decided to quit their jobs to launch an official gu vi platform that would make available mentors practice material and job opportunities
ar un had 14 years of experience in the it industry and had worked with sym ant ec earlier bal am ur ug an and s ride vi had worked with pay pal leaving behind this cush ioned corporate life the three of them registered gu vi in no ve mber 2014 soon enough the start up received a chance to work with the q ee e project which aims to teach the python programming in 150 colleges in ind ia in local languages
in order to util ise gu vi students must create their accounts on the website and in turn they gain access to most of the videos free of cost students who opt to sign up for special packages advanced courses practice assignments etc have to pay fees ranging from rs 800 to rs 3 000 all the videos are made by industry professionals who work in the particular technology field if it is a video about android programming a developer who has some six years of experience in the field makes it or provides a voice over for it the content is made only by experts who have hands on knowledge said ar un gu vi has courses on programming from the beginner to expert levels databases web development and mobile development
